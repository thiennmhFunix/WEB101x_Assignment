                <h2>About Travel</h2>
                <p>Generous natural conditions and a submerged inland ecosystem have awarded Dong Thap with multiple valuable ecotourism resources, for example, Tram Chim National Park, known both locally and internationally. This is a miniature ecological model of Dong Thap Muoi and the habitat of red-head cranes - a precious bird species protected by the world. Tram Chim National Park also achieves 7 out of 9 criteria in the Ramsar list of wetlands of international importance. Also of importance is the Gao Giong ecotourism site.</p>
                <p>Situated by the bank of the Tien River, the flower village of Sa Dec is the homeland of hundreds of "uncanny flowers and strange herbs". The village - one of the flower centers in the south of Vietnam - covers an area of around 300 ha for planting flowers and ornamental trees.</p>
