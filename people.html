                <h2>About People</h2>
                <p>Dong Thap's people are a special mix of cultures, languages and historical backgrounds. The one common denominator amongst them is that, as in most Southwest Asia countries, they love to smile and are genuinly interested in foreign visitors. The new generation of Vietnamese are largely unfamiliar with the devastation the country suffered years ago and should be approached thus. Enjoy your visit to this charming land.</p>
                <p>The most appropriate manner of greeting is a gentle handshake and a smile. Though occasionally rigid, Vietnamese officials - such as the police - appreciate being treated in a firm, yet diplomatic manner. It is best to deal with misunderstandings with patience and good humour. Local people who offer assistance appreciate small gifts such as cigarette lighters, pens, foreign cigarettes, liquor, perfume and even shampoo.</p>
